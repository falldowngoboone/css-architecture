// vendor CSS

// Since vendors typically provide an expanded and a compressed version of their
// styles, I would recommend using the expanded/uncompressed version here. Sass
// will take care of the compression for you and you will be able to easily
// debug styles in here to override in your _hacks file. Just make sure you
// change the extension to `.scss`.
//
// These styles should NEVER be modified directly. Use the cascade to do that.
