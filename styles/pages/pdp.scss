// pdp.scss

// This is where PDP-specific styles live. These types of files will be made
// mostly of components.

// Note I can directly reference directories outside of this one thanks to the
// `--load-path=path/to/styles` setting in my `build` script. If you don't do
// that, you would have to refer to them relatively (`../components/...`).
// Ain't nobody got time for that.

// See https://sass-lang.com/documentation/cli/dart-sass#load-path
